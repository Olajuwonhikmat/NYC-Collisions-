# NYC Motor Vehicle Collisions Analysis 

## Project Overview

This project presents a detailed analysis of motor vehicle collisions in New York City using data reported by the NYPD between January and August. The goal is to identify trends, risk factors, and high-incidence locations in order to support data-driven recommendations for road safety improvements. The analysis was completed as part of a Data Analytics Bootcamp Capstone Project using Power BI and Power Query.


## Dataset Description

- **Source**: NYPD Motor Vehicle Collisions
- **Timeframe**: January to August (Year unspecified in the dataset; assumed to be recent)
- **Records**: Each entry represents a unique collision, including:
  - Date and time of the crash
  - Borough and street location
  - Latitude and longitude
  - Number of persons injured or killed
  - Contributing factors
  - Vehicle types involved



## Tools Used

- **Power BI** (for data modeling, visualization, DAX)
- **Power Query** (for data cleaning and transformation)
- **DAX** (for creating measures and KPIs)


## Insights

- Accidents were fairly consistent across the months, with minor spikes in **February** and **September**.
- **Fridays** and **rush hours (8 AM and 5‚Äì6 PM)** had the highest number of reported accidents.
- **Fatal accidents** peaked at around **1 AM**, indicating elevated risk during nighttime driving.
- **Brooklyn** experienced the highest accident rate, followed by **Manhattan** and **The Bronx**.
- A few streets accounted for a **disproportionate number of collisions**, signaling local danger zones.
- **Driver distraction**, **failure to yield**, and **following too closely** were the most common contributing factors.
- **Fatal crashes** were often linked to **loss of consciousness** and **inattentive driving**.
- While fatalities were fewer, they were often severe; injuries were more widespread across the city.



## KPIs Displayed in Dashboard

- Total Number of Accidents
- Total Fatal Accidents
- Total Injuries
- Total Fatalities
- Peak Hour for Accidents 


##  Recommendations

- **Enhance driver awareness** through education focused on reducing distraction and improving rule compliance.
- **Deploy enforcement** more strategically during **high-risk hours** (rush hours and late nights).
- **Improve infrastructure** on high-incident streets, including traffic calming measures and better signage.
- **Focus borough-level interventions** in Brooklyn and other areas with high accident density.
- **Implement nighttime safety initiatives** such as DUI checkpoints, better lighting, and fatigue-awareness campaigns.
